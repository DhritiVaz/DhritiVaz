# Hi, I'm Dhriti Vaz
*Web Developer • Learning & Building • Always Improving*

I’m a developer exploring web technologies, writing lots of code, making mistakes, fixing them, and slowly getting better.  
Right now I’m working on full-stack basics and creating simple, real-world projects that help me learn by doing.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
### 🧾 Centralized Billing System (Internship Project)
A simple Tally-like billing system made during my internship:
- Add & manage customers  
- Create invoices  
- Track payments  
- Simple, clean dashboard  
- Full CRUD operations  
- Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript + basic backend APIs  

Not perfect — but it works, and it taught me a lot.
